## SnowFall

A simple snow falling animation program in C. Not very optimized because it draws each snowflake via five individual pixels per snowflake each frame instead of using a texture.

There are three usage options:

    ./snowfall
Run with default settings (1000 snowflakes, no speed modifiers, 1280x720)

	./snowfall [number flakes] [horizontal speed] [vertical speed]
Run and specify number of flakes and speed modifiers, 1280x720 resolution

	./snowfall [number flakes] [horizontal speed] [vertical speed] [width] [height]
Run and specify all parameters.
